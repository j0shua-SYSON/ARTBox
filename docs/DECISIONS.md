# Architecture decisions

## ADR 0001 - Cross-platform build tooling (accepted, M0)

Use Python's standard library for build orchestration, validation, packaging and
environment setup. CMake builds the portable core and generates the Xcode app.
Windows, macOS and Linux share the same entry point. Build/cache paths are configurable; existing user SDK and credential settings
are inherited. Keep host-specific policy, scripts and notes in ignored `work/`.
See [building](building.md).

## ADR 0002 - Small C platform boundary (accepted, M0)

The portable core emits length-delimited messages through a synchronous
caller-owned callback. The host writes stdout; UIKit copies messages before
dispatching to the main queue. No global logger, platform headers or UIKit
objects enter the core.

## ADR 0003 - CMake generates the Xcode app (accepted, M0)

Use one CMake definition for portable C and a conditional UIKit app target.
Target arm64/iphoneos/iOS 15 or later. Build Release with signing disabled before
explicit ad-hoc transport signing. Generated projects give Mac users a normal
Xcode provisioning entry point. The bundle identifier is configurable.

## ADR 0004 - Record build and execution evidence separately (accepted, M0)

Host CI, iOS compile/sign verification, and physical-device execution establish
different things. An empty-entitlement `codesign -s -` IPA is a transport
artifact, following S5LBox's build pattern. Record each milestone's CI results,
measurements and device status before tagging. The project owner waived physical
device checks for all milestones. They are optional evidence, never a milestone
gate. Automated acceptance, CI and artifact checks remain required; a waiver
does not establish physical-device execution or lifecycle behavior.

## ADR 0005 - Signed native packaging (accepted, M1)

The pre-implementation [loader comparison](loader-design.md) required both
approaches against identical ELF input. Both signed candidates now execute on
ARM64 macOS and build for iOS 15; see [M1 evidence](acceptance/m1.md). Select the
Apple-linker wrapper for M2: Apple tools own container metadata, the signed
fixture is smaller, and the host experiment shows no invocation penalty.
Keep the converter as an experimental comparison. Physical iPhone execution
remains unverified under ADR 0004. Signing bytes does not adapt Android TLS,
reserved registers or the function ABI.
No writable/executable mappings or runtime instruction mutation. Unsupported
post-install native code must fail explicitly.

## ADR 0006 - Scope and license boundaries (accepted, M0)

M0 contains no AOSP. Inspect and pin only the components required for the current
milestone. Dependencies retain their actual licenses, including Bionic's BSD
notices. No GPL reference implementation is copied into the MIT core. No GMS,
vendor blobs, guest kernel, CPU interpreter or JIT is part of ARTBox.

## ADR 0007 - Python for build-time packaging (accepted, M1)

The packer is a Python standard-library host tool. It validates a controlled
static ELF, replaces syscall sites before signing, and emits both a direct
Mach-O dylib and an assembly wrapper containing identical transformed bytes.
The runtime parser, syscall dispatcher and memory interface remain portable C.
The host packer's stricter input validation is independent of the runtime parser;
neither is a general dynamic linker yet.

Keep code and read-only constants at their original relative addresses in one
Mach-O text segment. The wrapper uses a regular section in `__TEXT` because it
contains both instructions and constants. LLVM rejected `some_instructions` as
an assembly section attribute; segment protection, not that annotation, controls
execution. Local LLVM inspection validates the container/export layout and
generated veneers. ARM64 macOS CI additionally loads both signed frameworks
through dyld and executes their guest code on the native CPU. The iOS build
checks signatures and bundle contents; physical execution remains unverified.

The instruction allowlist enforces this fixture's ABI contract. It does not
establish isolation from malicious native code inside the host process.

## ADR 0008 - Pin Bionic independently of the platform tree (accepted, M2)

Use the AOSP Bionic `android-15.0.0_r1` archive and commit recorded in
`third_party/sources.json`. Fetch through the GitHub CLI and verify archive and
notice hashes. Stage original sources in the configured cache; compatibility
patches and build selections belong in the repository. Extract regular files
and materialize internal header aliases without requiring symlink privileges.
Omit the listed editor/versioner files and unused, case-colliding netfilter
headers. Additional allocator and loader dependencies require their own pins
and license reviews. The NDK supplies a compiler, not a substitute runtime libc.

## ADR 0009 - Preserve ELF load bias in the signed wrapper (proposed, M2)

Start with source-built Bionic and suite ELFs using a controlled link layout.
Group immutable content in signed Mach-O text and writable content in aligned
data segments. Verify that the final Apple-linked image preserves the ELF
address differences for every loaded range before signing. This permits normal
data relocations using one image load bias. Reject layouts that fail that
comparison; do not repair signed instructions at runtime.

An arbitrary existing ELF may need retained static relocations and further
build-time transformation. That generalization is not established by a
controlled source-built image. The runtime loader will validate dynamic tables,
resolve dependencies and symbols in a guest namespace, relocate owned writable
data, establish TLS, protect RELRO and invoke precompiled constructors. Each
operation needs tests before it is used by Bionic.

## 0010 — Prepare data relocations before modifying a loaded image

Status: accepted for M2's relocation API; runtime integration pending.

Signed code cannot be repaired at runtime, and a failed import lookup must not
leave a half-relocated data image available to guest code. The portable engine
therefore takes explicit writable PT_LOAD views and immutable source metadata.
It prepares all RELA/RELR writes, checks destinations and resolves ordinary
symbols before committing any bytes. It never maps memory or calls guest code.
PLT entries resolve eagerly, avoiding a runtime-generated lazy-binding path.

The cost is temporary storage and sorting proportional to relocation count.
Overlapping/composed writes are rejected; IFUNC and TLS need separate runtime
support before they can participate. A caller-provided resolver keeps Android
symbol scope separate from host `dlsym`. RELRO protection belongs after data
relocation, and the signed-package verifier must independently establish that
the supplied load bias matches executable and writable segment addresses.

Portable failure tests and byte comparisons against LLVM-expanded relocations
on actual NDK outputs cover this API. They do not establish Bionic execution.

## 0011 — Keep guest TLS in host TLS and preserve Apple's reserved registers

Status: accepted for the current Bionic source profile; dynamic execution pending.

The first object inventory showed that compiler register reservations alone do
not remove Bionic's inline x18 writes or TPIDR_EL0 access. Apple's [ARM64 ABI
documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms)
reserves x18. Replacing Darwin's thread pointer is incompatible with host code
on the same native thread.

We considered a dedicated guest register, a host thread-key lookup, and the
host compiler's ordinary TLS. Use ordinary host TLS to hold a borrowed Bionic
slot pointer, with swap/restore for nested entries. Pointer-only precompiled
C endpoints provide Bionic's getter and setter; the hidden `__set_tls` wrapper
remains defined inside Bionic. The runtime must establish the guest TLS layout
and own its lifetime before calling Bionic. No generated trampoline is needed.

The source overlay omits Android shadow-call-stack setup and cleanup; packaged
guest code must not use that x18-based instrumentation. Compiler stack checks
remain enabled and use Bionic's global guard, preserving upstream exceptions
for bootstrap/initialization code. Baseline Armv8-A atomics are emitted inline
instead of importing Android's outlined, CPU-feature-dependent helpers. These
choices trade an extra TLS call/lookup, potentially slower atomics and loss of
Android SCS for an ABI that can coexist with the host. Timing and hardening
assessment remain required; the build does not claim equivalent protection.

Edits apply only to hash-verified source copies under the build directory.
The upstream control and adapted profile preserve 171 global definitions across
34 units. The native object has no checked TPIDR, x18/x27/x28, SVC or unknown
instructions. Host tests verify per-thread and nested binding isolation. These
checks do not prove full Bionic ABI compatibility or native guest execution.

## No-JIT cost ledger

| Constraint | Consequence / evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare native code before signing | The M1 fixture is transformed and signed at build time; adding native code requires a rebuilt, signed bundle. General native libraries remain unsupported. |
| No ART JIT or runtime code patching | Use the DEX interpreter or signed host-produced AOT; slowdown not measured. |
| No executable anonymous mappings | Guest executable `mmap`/`mprotect` requests fail explicitly. |
| Fix ABI/TLS/syscalls before install | Native input compatibility is constrained and must be tested. |
| AOT depends on ART/boot image/compiler versions | Pin the complete AOT provenance. |
| No runtime-generated native trampolines | Use precompiled ABI bridges or supported DEX interpreter paths. |
| Guest TLS must coexist with host TLS | The Bionic source profile uses a precompiled call and host TLS lookup; runtime cost remains unmeasured. |
| Android register and CPU-runtime assumptions cannot carry over unchanged | The current source profile omits Android SCS, uses a global stack guard and emits baseline atomics; performance and hardening tradeoffs remain to be measured. |
